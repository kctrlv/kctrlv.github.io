<h1>How to handle a wasp that got in your house</h1>
<p>August 10, 2016</p>
<p>Hello there. Today I’m going to guide you through the process of removing the uninvited flying guest known as a wasp from your house.</p>

<p>What you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A flat surface such as a wall or a table</li>
  <li>A plastic cup or a spindle lid</li>
  <li>A somewhat rigid piece of paper (check your spam mail)</li>
</ul>

<p>Find a suitable container to enclose the unsuspecting wasp. The characteristic traits of a suitable container are transparency, sturdiness, and lightness of weight.</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-waiting-game">Phase 2: Waiting Game</h3>

<p>Follow the wasp around until it lands on a flat surface. This can be a table, a wall, a floor. Hopefully it won’t have to be the ceiling.</p>

<p>Eventually s/he will land. Don’t try to force this part, let it happen naturally.</p>

<p>The wasp is now taking a break from flying. Keeping your composure, approach it from behind and without any hesitation, lay down the dome.</p>

<p>The OrderUp cup was the best suitor for the job in this case. Slightly opaque, sturdy, never actually used for drinking. Thank you OrderUp.</p>

<h3 id="phase-4-shuttle-service">Phase 4: Shuttle Service</h3>

<p>Find a rigid piece of paper, slide it under the cup/spindle cover, and transform this stationary space into a mobile one.</p>

<p>Head for the door once you have a reliably rigid transport vehicle. Leave the wasp outside, knock over the dome and close your door. The removal is now complete.</p>
