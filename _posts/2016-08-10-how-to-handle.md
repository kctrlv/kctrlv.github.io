Hello there. Today I'm going to guide you through the process of removing the uninvited flying guest known as a wasp from your house.

What you will need:

* A flat surface such as a wall or a table
* A plastic cup or a spindle lid
* A somewhat rigid piece of paper (check your spam mail)

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Find a suitable container to enclose the unsuspecting wasp. The characteristic traits of a suitable container are transparency, sturdiness, and lightness of weight.

### Phase 2: Waiting Game

Follow the wasp around until it lands on a flat surface. This can be a table, a wall, a floor. Hopefully it won't have to be the ceiling.

Eventually s/he will land. Don't try to force this part, let it happen naturally.

### Phase 3: The Capture

The wasp is now taking a break from flying. Keeping your composure, approach it from behind and without any hesitation, lay down the dome.

The OrderUp cup was the best suitor for the job in this case. Slightly opaque, sturdy, never actually used for drinking. Thank you OrderUp.

### Phase 4: Shuttle Service

Find a rigid piece of paper, slide it under the cup/spindle cover, and transform this stationary space into a mobile one.

Head for the door once you have a reliably rigid transport vehicle. Leave the wasp outside, knock over the dome and close your door. The removal is now complete.
